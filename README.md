# Snake-Game
Overview:

A simple Snake game involves a snake that moves around a grid, trying to eat food while avoiding colliding with itself or the boundaries. As the snake eats food, it grows longer.

Core Components:

Game Board: A 2D grid representing the playing area.
Snake: A series of connected squares that represent the snake's body.
Food: A randomly placed object that the snake must eat to grow.
Game Loop: A continuous loop that updates the game state, handles user input, and redraws the screen.

Game Mechanics:
Movement: The snake moves in a direction specified by the user (up, down, left, right).
Eating Food: When the snake's head collides with food, it grows longer by adding a new segment to its tail.
Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries.

Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Java
Graphics Library: Swing or JavaFX for creating the game's visual components.
Game Loop: Use a while loop or a timer to update the game state continuously.

Additional Considerations:
User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface with clear controls and informative messages.
Sound Effects: Add sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience.
Game Over Screen: Display a message when the game ends, along with the player's final score.

By implementing these components and features, you can create a basic Snake game in Java. You can then expand on the project by adding more complex features like power-ups, obstacles, or multiplayer modes.
